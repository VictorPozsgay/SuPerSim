normdev_week_month:
    Plot of the normalized deviation (or standardized anomaly, defined to be the
    deviation away from the mean in units of standard deviation) for the total
    water production, air temperature, and ground temperatures (surface, 1m ,5m,
    and 10m). The time period corresponds to the year of the landslide and the
    precise date of the event is indicated by a dashed red vertical line. For
    each time of the year, the value is compared to all values at the same time
    of the year for all previous years, and in the week (left) or month (right)
    leading to it.

normdev_week_month_altitude3100_slope60:
    Plot of the normalized deviation (or standardized anomaly, defined to be the
    deviation away from the mean in units of standard deviation) for the total
    water production, air temperature, and ground temperatures (surface, 1m ,5m,
    and 10m). The time period corresponds to the year of the landslide and the
    precise date of the event is indicated by a dashed red vertical line. For
    each time of the year, the value is compared to all values at the same time
    of the year for all previous years, and in the week (left) or month (right)
    leading to it. The ensemble analyzed here is a subset of the full ensemble,
    corresponding to simulations with altitude=3100m, slope=60°.

normdev:
    Plot of the normalized deviation (or standardized anomaly, defined to be the
    deviation away from the mean in units of standard deviation) for the total
    water production, air temperature, and ground temperatures (surface, 1m ,5m,
    and 10m). The time period corresponds to the transient period and each data
    point is compared to all previous data points. If applicable, the exact time
    of the landslide is indicated by a dashed red vertical line.

normdev_altitude3100_slope60:
    Plot of the normalized deviation (or standardized anomaly, defined to be the
    deviation away from the mean in units of standard deviation) for the total
    water production, air temperature, and ground temperatures (surface, 1m ,5m,
    and 10m). The time period corresponds to the transient period and each data
    point is compared to all previous data points. If applicable, the exact time
    of the landslide is indicated by a dashed red vertical line. The ensemble
    analyzed here is a subset of the full ensemble, corresponding to simulations
    with altitude=3100m, slope=60°.

normdev_bar:
    Plot of the normalized deviation (or standardized anomaly, defined to be the
    deviation away from the mean in units of standard deviation) of mean annual
    values with respect to background values for the total water production, air
    temperature, and ground temperatures (surface, 1m ,5m, and 10m). By
    definition, the sum of all deviations within the background cancel out. On
    top of this, for each year in the transient area, its mean annual value is
    compared to the ones of all previous years and a percentile is computed. A
    marker indicates whether it is a new maximum, or a particularly high value
    relative to previous years.
